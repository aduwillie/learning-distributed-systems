# Thinking in Kubernetes

Key notes:
1. Pods manage containers
2. ReplicaSets manage Pods
3. Services expose pods processes to the outside world
4. ConfigMaps and Secrets help you configure Pods
5. Labels are how things are found (plumbing of everything)
6. Deployments manage the change from one set of replicas/pods to another
